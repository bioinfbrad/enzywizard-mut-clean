# EnzyWizard-Mut-Clean


EnzyWizard-Mut-Clean is a command-line tool for cleaning both a wild-type
protein structure and its corresponding mutant protein structure, tracing 
cleaned amino acid substitution(s), generating
multi-format cleaned protein files (CIF, PDB, and FASTA), and providing a detailed 
traceable cleaning report. It standardizes residue
names, removes problematic residues (non-standard residues, residues with
missing backbone atoms, residues with missing required heavy atoms, residues
with unexpected heavy atoms, residues with invalid occupancy), repairs residue
order by renumbering residues continuously, converts both structures into
cleaned single protein chains, optionally adds hydrogens using OpenMM, remaps
the input amino acid substitution(s) to the cleaned residue number(s),
and outputs cleaned structure files together with a JSON report summarizing
residue mapping and cleaning statistics for both wild-type and mutant
structures.

   This report helps users track:
   - how residues in both structures were retained and renumbered,
   - how residue names were standardized,
   - how hydrogen content changed after optional hydrogen addition,
   - and how the input mutation positions were translated into the cleaned
     residue numbering system.

## Process:
This command processes the input wild-type and mutant protein structures as follows:

1. Load the input structures
   - Read the wild-type CIF or PDB file using Biopython (Bio.PDB).
   - Read the mutant CIF or PDB file using Biopython (Bio.PDB).
   - Resolve the protein names from the input filenames.

2. Validate basic input conditions
   - Check that both input files exist.
   - Check that the wild-type and mutant filenames are valid and not identical.
   - Extract a single chain from each structure.
   - Check that the wild-type and mutant sequence lengths are valid.
   - Check that the input amino acid substitution format is valid.
   - Check that mutation positions fall within the residue index ranges of both structures.
   - Check that the pH value is within the valid range.

3. Clean both structures independently (Biopython-based processing)
   - Extract a single chain from each structure using Biopython structure utilities.
   - Standardize residue names using the MODRES mapping.
   - Remove residues with missing backbone atoms (N, CA, C).
   - Remove residues with missing required heavy atoms.
   - Remove residues with unexpected heavy atoms.
   - Remove residues with invalid occupancy.
   - Remove insertion codes.
   - Repair discontinuous residue numbering by rebuilding residue indices.
   - Renumber all kept residues continuously starting from 1.
   - Rebuild each output structure as a single chain with chain ID A.

4. Remap amino acid substitution
   - Build residue mapping relationships from original residue numbering to cleaned
     residue numbering for both wild-type and mutant structures.
   - Convert the input amino acid substitution(s) into cleaned amino acid
     substitution(s) using the residue mapping results.

5. Optionally add hydrogens
   - Convert each cleaned Biopython structure into an OpenMM object.
   - Use OpenMM Modeller.addHydrogens() with a specified pH.
   - Convert the hydrogen-added structures back into Biopython structures.

6. Validate the cleaned structures
   - Check that each cleaned structure contains exactly one model and one chain.
   - Check that the cleaned chain ID is A.
   - Check that residue numbering is continuous.
   - Check that only standardized standard amino acid residues remain.
   - Check that required backbone and heavy atoms are present.
   - Check that no unexpected heavy atoms remain.
   - Verify that mapped residue coordinates are preserved after cleaning.
   - Check that the cleaned wild-type and mutant sequence lengths are equal.

7. Save outputs
   - Save the cleaned wild-type structure in CIF format (Biopython MMCIFIO).
   - Save the cleaned wild-type structure in PDB format (Biopython PDBIO).
   - Extract and save the cleaned wild-type amino acid sequence in FASTA format.
   - Save the cleaned mutant structure in CIF format (Biopython MMCIFIO).
   - Save the cleaned mutant structure in PDB format (Biopython PDBIO).
   - Extract and save the cleaned mutant amino acid sequence in FASTA format.
   - Generate and save the JSON report summarizing mutation remapping,
     residue mappings, and cleaning statistics for both structures.
